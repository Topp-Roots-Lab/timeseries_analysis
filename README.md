# timeseries_analysis
The R scripts were written to analyze and visualize root traits over time from DynamicRoots-generated files. I have tested the code under R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15). It should work in the latest R version. 

To run the code, the following packages are required: 
ggplot2, ggpubr, gridExtra, LaplacesDemon, plyr, ggfortify
